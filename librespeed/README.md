1. Copy the following files to your web server's shared folder (ie. /var/www/html/speedtest for Apache): index.html, speedtest.js, speedtest_worker.js, favicon.ico and the backend folder
1. Optionally, copy the results folder too, and set up the database using the config file in it.
1. Be sure your permissions allow execute (755).
1. Visit YOURSITE/speedtest/index.html and voila!

## Android app

A template to build an Android client for your LibreSpeed installation is available [here](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-android).

## CLI client

A command line client is available [here](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-cli).

## Docker

A docker image is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/pkgs/container/speedtest), check our [docker documentation](doc_docker.md) for more info about it.
The image is built every week to include an updated version of the ipinfo-DB used for ISP detection. Also this ensures, that the latest security patches in PHP are installed. Therefore we recommend to use the `latest` image.

## Go backend

A Go implementation is available in the [`speedtest-go`](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) repo, maintained by [Maddie Zhan](https://github.com/maddie).

## Rust backend

A Rust implementation is available in the [`speedtest-rust`](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-rust) repo, maintained by [Sudo Dios](https://github.com/sudodios).

## Node.js backend

A partial Node.js implementation is available in the `node` branch, developed by [dunklesToast](https://github.com/dunklesToast). It's not recommended to use at the moment.
